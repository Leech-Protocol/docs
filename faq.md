### What is Mechanic of Mixed pools work?

All our mixed pools will consist of several pairs. For instance, we might add five medium-risk pairs to a high-risk pool. We implement this to enable liquidity reallocation among pairs on platforms like Velodrome in search of the most profitable conditions. 
At the moment, we have added one token pair to each mixed pool. 

Mixed pool (High risk) is a liquidity mining strategy on the BNB chaine network, utilizing Thena.fi DEX. The strategy includes farming on highly profitable stablecoin pairs such as wUSDR / USDC. 

Mixed pool (Medium risk) is a liquidity mining strategy on the Optimism network, utilizing Velodrome DEX. The strategy includes farming on medium profitable pairs such as sAMMV2-CHI/DAI.

Mixed pool (Low risk) is a liquidity mining strategy on the Optimism network, utilizing Sushiswap DEX. The strategy includes farming on low risk stablecoin pairs such as USDT / USDC.

### What are the deposit/withdrawal fees on the 2nd stage?

There might be few external fees:

- When depositing coins from one blockchain to a pool on a different blockchain, the fee for the Stargate bridge will be ≈$1.
- When depositing one coin (e.g., USDT) into a pool with another coin (e.g., USDC), the fee for the swap will range ≈ from $0.5 to $1
- Also, there will be a swap fee if you're creating a pair within an LP by one coin (e.g., USDT), for instance, like USDT/USDC.

### How is APR formed in Leech Protocol pools?

Leech Protocol is a yield aggregator. Therefore, it extracts APR from the pools of the protocols it interacts with.
