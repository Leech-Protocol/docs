Vaults are specialized investment tools designed for yield farming, utilizing automated processes to consistently allocate and reinvest deposited funds. This approach enables the accumulation of substantial compound interest over time.

By using the Leech Protocol  vault to earn your profits you will significantly reduce the number of transactions, along with their corresponding gas expenses. Rather than engaging in manual tasks like harvesting and liquidating rewards, purchasing additional tokens, and ongoing reinvestment, a vault performs all these actions automatically and at a rapid pace.

Leech Protocol does not lock users' deposits in any Vault. Thus, users can withdraw the deposited sum at any time without a loss. However, to gain the most profit from the Vault, it is best to store the deposit for the Medium or Long term in order to have the effect from such deposit.
