LeechProtocol offers users multiple pools to deposit assets to. Users deposit their assets directly into a smart contract that manages user deposits and withdrawals into the offered vaults. 

Each pool is a smart contract representing a certain yield earning strategy. The smart contract works with different farm strategies assigned to the exact vault and is a logic of interaction with popular DeFi protocols with the purpose of making profit. It initiates work with the preferred DEX to  initiate further liquidity distribution.
