Leech Protocol allows users to easily farm on multiple chains. They deposit their
liquidity into the Leech Protocol, which then performs operations that the user would normally do manually. 

Depending on the type of strategy assigned to the vault - we distribute the user's deposit into liquidity pairs on Dexes. The deposit is splitted according to the shares necessary for the pair on DeX we work with, and then swapped and added as liquidity onto DeX. Next we receive rewards from the DeX, swap them into necessary tokens from the pair we work with and return them into the deposit to get more rewards.

With each swap, the amount of the deposit body can slightly change due to slippage. However, in the long term this deposit is growing as well as the userâ€™s profit.

How will it work? The user chooses a main asset, such as USDT or USDC, and deposits liquidity. Our system swaps liquidity, bridges it (if needed), and distributes it into a defined pool list. For instance, if a user picks USDT as their main asset, the system bridges it, swaps liquidity to different pools like USDT/USDC, USDC/MAI, ETH/wUSDR, etc.
