DeFi has unique costs and benefits, risks and protection mechanisms. Please keep this fact in mind when using this website and do not use Leech or any other system described on this website without a sufficient understanding of their unique risks and how they differ from traditional financial transactions. The only way to fully understand such risks is to have a clear understanding of the relevant technical systems and the incentive design mechanisms they embody. We recommend you to read the technical documentation and the Leech code before using them, and avoid depositing or lending more than 10-30% of your funds for DeFi protocols, including Leech."]},{"i":"#","p":["Leech smart contracts are open source, readable, and include tests. They are not a direct fork of an existing contract system. Two audits of the smart contracts have already been successfully completed by Hacken OÜ. However, a successful audit does not guarantee that a new or existing Leech strategy will achieve APY goals or avoid Leech hacks or contracts with which Leech integrates(Curve, Pancake Swap, Uniswap, Venus, Yieldyak etc.). Also be aware that the current version of Leech protocol is a beta version and as such the above risks are even higher.","Although Leech team has developed most of the source code for the Leech protocol, it does not provide, own or control the Leech protocol, which is managed by smart contracts deployed on the BSC blockchain and Avalanche. Accordingly, no developer or entity involved in the creation of the Leech protocol will be liable for any claim or loss arising from your use, inability to use or your interactions with other users of the Leech protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages or lost profits, cryptocurrency, tokens or anything else of value."]},{"i":"#","p":["Leech protocol manage many different assets and interact with many other protocols. This ability to link contracts gives Leech its value, but interacting with multiple contracts creates a risk if one of the contracts fails. Leech does its best to audit and assess the risks of the contracts Leech handles, but deposits are subject to the risks inherent in each strategy. Study the strategies used by the vaults in which you deposit to familiarize yourself with the risks.","We also highlight that transactions via protocols and contracts may be subject to additional third-party fees, such as cross-chain bridge fees or stablecoin exchange fees."]},{"i":"#","p":["If the team behind a token, either whitelisted or not, decides to abandon its project and takes the investors’ money, the project’s token will probably be worth $0. You are responsible for doing your own due diligence of the project and should understand that crypto are very-high risk, speculative investments. You should be aware and prepared to potentially lose some or all of the money invested."]},{"i":"#","p":["The stated APR or APY for a given token, vault or strategy (‘Rate') is expressed in units of the specific token in question, not in U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies. Each Rate is a forward-looking prediction based on a good faith belief as to how to reasonably predict results over the relevant period, but such belief is subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties (including smart contract security risks and third party actions) that could result in a material change (lower or higher) in APR or APY denominated in tokens. Rates are not offers, promises, agreements, guarantees or commitments by any person or group, but depend primarily on the performance of smart contracts and other autonomous or semi-autonomous systems (including third-party systems) and how third parties interact with those systems after you make a deposit. Even if a particular predicted Rate is achieved, you may still incur a financial loss in fiat money if the fiat money denominated value of the relevant tokens (your deposit and any tokens allocated or distributed to you in accordance with the Rate) declines during the term of the deposit. APR and APY are not interest rates payable on debt."]},{"i":"#","p":["Stablecoins are not necessarily stable. Stablecoins and synthetics can depeg from their target price and you can lose in value. Leech interacts with many stablecoins and synthetic representations of other assets. These assets may depend on collateral from other digital assets (DAI, sUSD, sBTC etc.) or may be bearer bonds that can only be redeemed for the underlying asset with a centralized third party (USDC, USDT, wBTC etc.). If the issuer blacklists the non-bearer asset or the synthetic asset becomes insufficiently collateralized, your positions holding or interacting with those assets may lose value or even become worthless."]},{"i":"#","p":["Impermanent loss (or Divergence Loss) is associated with providing assets to a liquidity pool. Liquidity pools are used on decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap or Curve, to create money markets and allow traders to buy and sell pool-supported assets. If you contribute liquidity funds to an automated market maker, you may lose some or all of the amount you invested if the relative value of assets in the automated market maker changes. If even one of the assets in the pool depreciates or becomes worthless, your entire position in the pool, regardless of the assets you originally provided when you entered the pool, may lose value or become worthless.If you provide liquidity to the pool and one of the assets increases in value relative to others in the pool, you may not make as much money as you could have if you had held those assets instead of placing them in the pool. It is critical to understand the mathematics of impermanent losses before providing liquidity. Many yield farming strategies, including the yield farming strategies used by Leech, provide incentives to provide liquidity in AMMs. These incentives do not guarantee that providing liquidity will be profitable for you."]},{"i":"#","p":["The Leech team is not responsible for the consequences of using Leech by you from a jurisdiction that restricts or prohibits the use of cryptocurrency, tokens, DeFi protocols or smart contracts and we recommend that you stop using Leech from such jurisdiction. We also recommend to seek a professional legal advice prior to using our protocol in your place of residence.","This Disclaimer can be found at here.

Countries are even beginning to implement cryptocurrencies as legal tender.","Figure 1. Google search results for DeFi around the world over the past two years. Source: Google Trends as of 04.05.2022","This new technology is unknown, engaging, and promising, but the most important reason for its rise in popularity is people looking for alternative ways to earn money (preferably remotely, with minimum effort), and store value.","Using DeFi is currently very complicated for inexperienced users due to the lack of a refined User Experience. Users need to understand how multiple blockchains work, which tokens are on which chains, where and how their yields are generated, etc. As time goes on, this issue is being remedied. Bridges have become popular for moving assets across different chains, and in the future, users won’t know or care what blockchain they are using. It's time for cross-chain: a technology that the crypto market has been missing, until now. Leech Protocol is one of the first automatic DeFi cross-chain yield aggregators to earn optimal profits on different blockchains."]},{"l":"The Problem","p":["Users who utilize yield farming services look for dapps on different blockchains that provide the highest returns. As a rule, such users have a complex farming system built: they look for pools on other blockchains, build the most optimal strategies algorithmically, constantly monitor the state of the crypto market, and transfer their liquidity when they discover a better location.","Inexperienced users are generally afraid of the words such as blockchain, DeFi, and token. These users need a simple and affordable solution that will introduce them to decentralized finance.","Farming was originally conceived as a passive income, however, with the advent of a large number of blockchains, platforms and various strategies, all this has become routine work. User is actively involved in tracking trends on different blockchains, determines the strategies, and calculates the risks. All this takes time - the most valuable resource in the world. We want to make DeFi easy again."]},{"l":"Value Proposition","p":["Leech Protocol allows users to easily farm on multiple chains. They deposit their liquidity into Leech Protocol, which then performs operations that the user would normally do manually. Leech has incorporated protocols like Curve, PancakeSwap, Uniswap, etc. with specific liquidity pairs that are monitored.","If a user deposits, for example, some USDT into Leech Protocol, he deposits it in one place, and doesn’t need to worry about anything else. He doesn’t have to choose which blockchains to farm on or look for good yield, our protocol does it all for him. By aggregating multiple blockchains, it finds the best place to put his liquidity to generate optimal profitability. If the yield falls by X%, his liquidity is moved to another location that is more suitable. This is just one example of Leech’s functionality, and more complex strategies with various risk levels and returns will be added in the future.","A natural question arises - how is our product different from existing aggregators?","Today, cross-chain farming is a poorly developed area. Few entrepreneurs are looking in this direction and we aim to be the premiere service in this market.","Currently, existing aggregators still have a number of limitations:","The User must provide liquidity on the desired blockchain, and this is a big issue, as he then has to know which blockchain is best for his desires, and how to navigate many different chains.","There are offers from 50+ pools, and a User chooses which one to use.","No system will choose the most favorable conditions for the User. Now, the user needs to log in every day, check the status of his liquidity, and calculate his returns manually. The APY shown is often different from the actual returns that the User receives. Users can spend 3-5 days reviewing their strategy. Ultimately, it becomes daily routine work.","Leech Protocol allows our users to permanently participate in the process of creating optimal profitability. How does it work?","Figure 2 shows how the protocol works. It is important to understand that the essence of the entire protocol is not to “transfer” liquidity from blockchain to blockchain but to create strategies for these transfers and constantly improve them.","Below are more details on the strategies themselves. What ensures profitability? A feature of our product is automatic complex multi-part strategies that our team develops and updates. Strategies are built based on exploring the capabilities of each blockchain and creating a plan for safe earnings.","Furthermore, Leech Protocol is automatically engaged in choosing the best strategy for each User. Strategy example","Buy Cake Tokens and go short with double leverage for 33% of the total and deposit the remaining 67% in an auto compounding farm on Pancake Swap with about 80% APR. We get less income due to the 2x short (≈50% instead of 80%). But it's still better because it's safer. Instead of Cake, we could use any high volatility coin that can be hedged."]},{"l":"Lending and farming","p":["Another feature of Leech Protocol is a hybrid of lending and farming, which allows the User to get good returns with highly liquid assets. For example, the User deposits 1 Bitcoin into our platform, which serves as collateral, while the lent coins are also used in different protocols for farming. This allows the user to receive not just their classic return of 3-5% on their Bitcoin, but about 15-30% more.","Partial liquidation","Partial liquidations don't happen frequently. In the classic lending protocol, when the liquidation threshold is reached, the User’s assets could all be sold at an unfavorable rate with possible penalties. However, Leech Protocol allows the user to sell part of the assets necessary to cover the drawdown of the exchange rate difference, while the rest of the assets remain with the User. This enables our User to end up in a better condition."]},{"l":"Security","p":["We did a complete analysis of DeFi protocol hacks. We have classified all known hacks and worked out possible methods of protection against them. Security audits are a constant mechanism of Leech protocol. We will provide audits with the implementation of each feature that affects the work of smart contracts. Notification protocols have been developed to prevent transactions with suspicious activity. We plan to involve white hackers to test the security system of our product, as well as the use of Bug Bounties. Creation of the protocol’s own asset insurance fund and involvement of external insurance organizations is planned."]},{"l":"Market","p":["Figure 3 Source: defillama.com as of 04.05.2022 Currently, the decentralized finance sector represents only a tiny percentage of its maximum potential, and significant growth is inevitable.
