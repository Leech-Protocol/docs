If a user deposits, for example, some USDT into Leech Protocol, he deposits it in one place, and doesn’t need to worry about anything else. He doesn’t have to choose which blockchains to farm on or look for good yield, our protocol does it all for him. By aggregating multiple blockchains, it finds the best place to put his liquidity to generate optimal profitability.

It does this through transferring the liquidity between blockchains, searching for the best solution for the liquidity, loading the liquidity, and earning high profitability. This protocol combines farming strategies in different categories while taking into account risks and profitability.","The essence of Leech Protocol is not only to “transfer” liquidity from one blockchain to another but also to create strategies for these transfers and constantly improve them.

This approach enables the accumulation of substantial compound interest over time.","By using the Leech Protocol vault to earn your profits you will significantly reduce the number of transactions, along with their corresponding gas expenses. Rather than engaging in manual tasks like harvesting and liquidating rewards, purchasing additional tokens, and ongoing reinvestment, a vault performs all these actions automatically and at a rapid pace.","Leech Protocol does not lock users' deposits in any Vault.

They deposit their liquidity into the Leech Protocol, which then performs operations that the user would normally do manually.","Depending on the type of strategy assigned to the vault - we distribute the user's deposit into liquidity pairs on Dexes. The deposit is splitted according to the shares necessary for the pair on DeX we work with, and then swapped and added as liquidity onto DeX. Next we receive rewards from the DeX, swap them into necessary tokens from the pair we work with and return them into the deposit to get more rewards.","With each swap, the amount of the deposit body can slightly change due to slippage. However, in the long term this deposit is growing as well as the user’s profit.","How will it work? The user chooses a main asset, such as USDT or USDC, and deposits liquidity. Our system swaps liquidity, bridges it (if needed), and distributes it into a defined pool list.

Users need to understand how multiple blockchains work, which tokens are on which chains, where and how their yields are generated, etc. As time goes on, this issue is being remedied.

For example, the User deposits 1 Bitcoin into our platform, which serves as collateral, while the lent coins are also used in different protocols for farming. This allows the user to receive not just their classic return of 3-5% on their Bitcoin, but about 15-30% more.","Partial liquidation","Partial liquidations don't happen frequently. In the classic lending protocol, when the liquidation threshold is reached, the User’s assets could all be sold at an unfavorable rate with possible penalties.
