One of the key components of Mixpools is individual vaults with auto-compound functionality. However, users can independently utilize individual vaults, thereby easily constructing their own farm strategy across multiple chains.

Leech Protocol seeks out interesting pools for integration and aggregates them on the platform, continually expanding the assortment of available vaults.

All vaults feature auto-compound functionality.
